I have a lot of big soviet relays from which I created an irrigtaion control system.

We have one water source, pipe system with valves and 10 separate irrigation channels.

# So the current system can:

* Activate only one channel at a time - other channels are waiting for their turns.
* Every channel can be configured to one of seven different duration settings from 1 to 30 minutes.
* You can start a channel manually or automatically using the control board.
* Stop button cancels current channel execution. 
* If you hold the stop button for more than 5 seconds - the whole system is stopped.


System is assembled from the following soviet relays:

* voltage relays РН-53, РН-54;
* time control relays ВС-10-64, ВС-10-34, РВ-234;
* auxiliary relay РПУ-1
