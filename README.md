I have a lot of big soviet releys and I create an irrigtaion control.

We have one water source, pipe system with valves and 10 separate irrigtation channels.

# So the current system can:

* Activate only one channel per moment - another channels are waiting for it's end.
* Every channel can be configured to one of sevet diffetent time settings from 1 to 30 minutes.
* You can start the channel manually or automatically using the control board.
* Stop button cansel current channel execution. 
* If You press stop button more than 5 seconds - all system is stopped.


System is assembled from next soviet releys:

* voltage releys РН-53, РН-54;
* time control releys ВС-10-64, ВС-10-34, РВ-234;
* auxiliary reley РПУ-1
